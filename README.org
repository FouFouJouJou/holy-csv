#+TITLE: HolyCsv
A csv parsing library written in HolyC, the language of the gospel.

* Requirements
- [[https://holyc-lang.com/docs/intro][HolyC compiler]] is available in two variants, standalone or the one that ships with [[https://templeos.org/][TempleOS]], the operating system that was built by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis][Terry A. Davis]]. The same person who wrote HolyC.

* Instructions
The standalone compiler is the one being used and the behaviour is very strange. Passing pointer dereferences seg faults and the performace with large csv files is horrible.
May revert to using TempleOS instead.
